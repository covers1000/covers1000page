FINISHED:
*Deploy a new heroku dyno which uses soundcloud audio and computes features with librosa
[Used my own library instead from before when I made loop ditty in Python.  Modified it to be much more memory efficient]

*Port over new camera with zooming/panning in addition to rotation
[DONE]

*Make sure correct PCA is being used
[DONE]

*Fix loopditty cursive
[DONE: Changed to "welcome"]

*Get touch interaction to work
[Used the interactjs library]

*Have the option to upload a user's own song
This took a while.  Key code below:
def index(request):
    print "request = ", request
    if request.method == 'GET':
        #Step 1: Resolve sound cloud track URL
        if 'url' in request.GET:
            return processSoundcloudSong(request.GET['url'])
        else:
            return HttpResponse(json.dumps({"Error":"Need to input a soundcloud URL"}))
    elif request.method == 'POST':
        if 'file' in request.FILES:
            f = request.FILES['file']
            fs = FileSystemStorage()
            filename = fs.save(f.name, f)
            return processCustomAudio("media/" + filename)
        else:
            return HttpResponse(json.dumps({"Error":"Need to attach a music file"}))
    return HttpResponse("Need to input a soundcloud URL or attach a music file")


*Change Django settings.py for secure deployment
[DONE]

*Clear Disqus.  Put NSF RTG, NSF GRFP acknowledgements and link to IID and GeomData
[DONE]

*General work on aesthetics
[Went with a dark gray background and an off-white foreground]

*Have the option to check and uncheck different feature sets, and to change the length of the texture window (i.e. all delay window computation takes place client side)
-Highlight recompute button when changes have been made
[DONE]

*Add precomputed examples
[DONE]

*Share parameters button (share on twitter with twitpic or twitter gif)
-Anchor on viewer upon load
[DONE]
I have it so it can automatically make an animated GIF, and you can link to twitter.  I wasn't able to combine the two, and I couldn't get it to shorten the links that it puts on twitter, but it's enough that people can fill in the gaps themselves if they're so inclined.

TODO:


*Credit js libraries used
*Show/hide about text


Other:
*Store requested songs in a database, and/or cache features
*Make sure longer songs work (fix DelaySeries code)

*Figure out why clicking on slider doesn't work in chrome
