							<h1>The Dataset</h1>
							
							<h2>Description</h2>
							<p>This dataset was curated and checked by hand starting from 395 groups of songs randomly drawn from <a href = "https://secondhandsongs.com/">https://secondhandsongs.com</a>.  For each song, there is metadata (song name / artist name / release year), computed beat onset times, MFCCs, and HPCPs, which are all explained below in more detail.  Metadata is in text files and the beat onset times / MFCCs / HPCPs are individual .mat files for each song.  For each feature type, a set of songs which are all covers of each other are contained in the same folder, and their filename corresponds to their <a href = "https://secondhandsongs.com/">secondhandsongs ID</a>.  For instance, in the MFCC files, <code>384/263799_MFCC.mat</code> is the file containing MFCC features for the song at link <a href = "https://secondhandsongs.com/performance/263799">https://secondhandsongs.com/performance/<b>263799</b></a>, which happens to be the original version of LMFAO's "Party Rock Anthem."  </p>
							
							<p>
							<b>NOTE: All audio was resampled to 22050hz mono before these features were computed</b>

							<i>These feature have been provided without audio with the hopes that they can be useful in research without compromising any copyright arrangements.  <i>Please contact <a href = "http://www.ctralie.com">Chris Tralie</a> if you would like to compute another set of features on the dataset, and if you have code for doing so.

							<h2>Years</h2>
							Below is a histogram of years that songs in this dataset were recorded.  The earliest song is from <a href = "https://secondhandsongs.com/performance/231607">1905</a>, and the most recent songs are from 2016<BR><BR>

							<h2>Other Observations</h2>
							I took a lot of notes as I was going through curating the dataset, and I commented in places how the algorithm described in <a href = "ctralie2017_EarlyMFCC_HPCPFusion.pdf">the paper</a> works on various examples.  Below are the notes:
                            <ul>
                            <li>8: A good example of where the notes are quite different</li>
                            <li>12: Good example of screamo cross genre</li>
                            <li>21: The songs really diverge after the beginning</li>
                            <li>22: This is a language translation, so mfcc completely fails!</li>
                            <li>28: Good example where SSMs work, chroma fails</li>
                            <li>31: Another language translation</li>
                            <li>32: Difficult; very different stylistically (only fusion works)</li>
                            <li>34: Good example where one repeats a section that another doesn't</li>
                            <li>37: One has an intro that's lacking in the other</li>
                            <li>44: Good example of time warping</li>
                            <li>46: Difficult Example</li>
                            <li>52: Instrumental Only Cover</li>

                            <li>70: Time Warping (so SSM does badly)</li>
                            <li>72: Cross language translation (easy example)</li>
                            <li>74: Extreme cross genre example</li>
                            <li>75: Example where one has very non-distinct vocals and all modalities are needed to match</li>
                            <li>76: Good Cross Genre</li>
                            <li>81: An example where chroma does not do well due to the vast vocal embelishments</li>
                            <li>93: Long Intro In Long Version</li>
                            <li>95: Good Example of Complementary Features, very different tempos</li>
                            <li>98: Notes don't work well at all on this one; SSMs work best</li>
                            <li>103: SSMs work way better than chroma (reverb screws up the pitch)</li>
                            <li>107: Raw MFCCs work better here (probably due to the similar drums in the background)</li>
                            <li>112: Willie Nelson has a longer improv halfway through, Johnny Bush has a long improv at the end</li>

                            <li>127: Difficult example (old vocals not very distinct, needs to rely on pitch)</li>
                            <li>133: Difficult examples (stylistically very different)</li>
                            <li>134: Very different genres (Richard Cheese, 1000 Mona Lisas)</li>
